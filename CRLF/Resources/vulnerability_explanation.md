# CLRF Injection Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Explanation

This vulnerability occurs because the application accepts user input without proper validation.  
By inserting special characters such as:
\r
\n


an attacker can force a new line in the HTTP request headers. This can allow additional headers to be injected or the structure of the request to be altered.

## Impact / Risk

If successfully exploited, CLRF injection can lead to several issues, including:

- Session hijacking  
- Log poisoning  
- Manipulation of HTTP headers  
- Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of a user

## How to Prevent It

- Do not trust user input.  
- Sanitize or encode any user-controlled data used to build HTTP requests.  
- Reject or escape newline characters such as `\r` and `\n`.  
- Use functions that properly encode or validate data before processing.

## How the Flaw Was Found

During testing of the password recovery feature, adding `\r\n` into the email POST parameter allowed the injection of a new HTTP header line. This led to retrieving the flag, confirming the vulnerability.
