# Client-Side Validation Bypass

## Description

This challenge showcases a flaw where the application relies solely on **client-side validation** to enforce restrictions. Since client-side code can always be modified by the user, the application becomes vulnerable to manipulation through browser DevTools.

## How to Get the Flag

* Navigate to:

  ```
  http://localhost/index.php?page=survey
  ```

* Inspect the page using DevTools and locate the `<option>` element inside the survey form.

  Original:

  ```html
  <option value="1">1</option>
  ```

* By modifying the `value` attribute to a much larger number:

  ```html
  <option value="10000">1</option>
  ```

  and submitting the form, the server accepts the tampered value and returns the flag.

This works because the server does **not** verify whether the submitted value is allowed — it blindly trusts the client.

## Vulnerability Explanation

* Client-side restrictions (HTML attributes, JavaScript checks, dropdown limits) can always be modified.
* Without **server-side validation**, attackers can submit arbitrary values.
* This enables tampering with ratings, votes, or any numeric fields intended to be limited.

## Prevention of Vulnerability

* Never rely solely on client-side validation.
* Re-validate all incoming data on the **server side**, including:

  * Data type
  * Range / allowed values
  * Authorization to submit certain values
